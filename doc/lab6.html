<h1>Lab 6 - Catch signals</h1>
<p>
Write a small program that:
<ul>
	<li>Busy waits on while loop</li>
	<li>When user press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z, it prints out "OH NO!!!" and continue the busy wait</li>
	
</ul>
Hint: write signal handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and SIGTSTP (Ctrl-Z)<br>
For information on signal, refer to:<br>
http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node24.html<br>
To terminate the program, type "kill -9 [YOUR_PROCESS_ID]". This command sends SIGKILL signal which cannot be caught by your program!<br>
It's DUE at the end of this lab<br>
