Multi-process Game of Turns</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Summary</H2>
In this assignment, you will create two versions of a simple multi-process 
game : one without and another with 
inter-process synchronization. You will also measure the relative performance
of the two versions of your multi-process game.

<H2>Objectives</H2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Learn use of inter-process communication using shared memory and semaphores.
	</li>
	<li>
		Learn the basic workings of CPU scheduling in Linux.
	</li>
</ul>

<H2>Part A: Multi-Process Game of Turns</H2>
<P>
In this part, you are asked to write a simple program that takes two command-line arguments <b>P</b> and <b>N</b>.
The main process creates <B>P</B> other child processes, waits for all of them
to complete, and then exits. All the child processes form one logical ring among
each other. (In rest of the description, the term "process" refers to a "child process".) 
For example, if the processes are numbered 
1 to P, then 
<ul>
<li>
The next neighbor of process 1 is process 2,
</li>
<li>
The next neighbor of process i is process i+1 for all i &lt; P , and
</li>
<li>
The next neighbor of process P is process 1, which completes 
a ring among the processes. 
</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P> Assume that a <i>shared</i> integer variable, called <tt>turn</tt>, is located in a shared memory region and identifies the number of the process whose turn it is at any instant. 
</p>

<p>
A second <i>per-process local</i> variable 
in each process, called <tt>me</tt>, identifies the identity 
of each process (i.e. each process stores its own identity in a 
per-process local variable <tt>me</tt>). This identity doesn't 
have to be the process ID value. It could simply be the position of the process in the ring. For example, the me=1 for the first process in the ring, me=2 for the second and so on.
</p>

<p>
A third per-process 
<i>local</i> variable, called <tt>next</tt>, identifies the next 
process in the ring.</P>

<P>The processes sequentially pass
the turns among each other in the logical ring. 
When each process gets its turn, it increments another variable 
called <tt>counter</tt> in the shared memory region.
The pseudo-code within each process for passing turns might look something
as follows. 
</p>
<pre>
	while(turn != me ) 
		/* do nothing - just busy loop*/ ; 

	/* got my turn - increment counter */
	counter = counter + 1;

	/* give the turn to next process */
	turn = next;  
</pre>
(Note: Replace <tt>turn</tt> and <tt>counter</tt> 
above with appropriate ways of accessing this data in shared memory regions).

<p>The program terminates when the each process has received <tt>N</tt> turns.</p>

<P>In the above description, several programming details have been omitted
for you to figure out. This includes
<ul>
	<li>
	Creating <tt>P</tt> child processes from the main process.
	</li>
	<li>
	Constructing the logical ring among child processes.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Initializing each child process's identity in the <tt>me</tt> variable. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Initializing each child process' next neighbor in the <tt>next</tt> variable.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Initializing the shared memory region and the shared data values.
	</li>
	<li>
		Have the main process wait for child processes to complete <tt>N</tt> turns before exiting.
	</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H2>Part B: More Efficient Game of Turns</H2>
<P>You might notice that the program you wrote in Part A 
is inefficient because each process <i>busy loops</i> till the CPU scheduler
kicks it out (after its time-slice is over) and allows another 
process to execute and make progress.
(Does the program in Part A have a race condition? Why or why not?)</P>

<P> What we ideally want is that each process should be given control 
of the CPU <i><b>only when it is that process' turn</b></i>. Modify the program you wrote
in Part A (using appropriate synchronization mechanisms) such that <b><i>each process
gets to run (i.e., gets control of the CPU) only when it is that process's turn, and at no other time.</b></i></P>

<P>Again, you would need to work out the programming details of how and
where to use inter-process synchronization. A few hints:
<ul>
	<li>
		You will need to use semaphores.
	</li>
	<li>
		You will need to use more than one semaphore to do it right.
	</li>
	<li>
		Think whether you need semaphores for signaling, or locking critical sections, or for both.
	</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H2>Part C: Profiling the Game of Turns</H2>
<P>In this part, you are asked to write user-level profiling code in order
to compare the relative performance of the two versions of programs
you wrote in Part A and Part B. Use a combination of gettimeofday() 
system call and inter-process synchronization to measure (1) the average 
hand-over time between two consecutive processes in the ring
and (b) the total execution time to complete N turns. 
<p>
Hand-over time is defined here as the time duration from when one process 
indicates that it is the next process's turn to when that next process 
realizes it is its turn and starts progressing.
<p>
Plot two graphs (a) Hand-over time versus number of processes P, and (b) total execution time versus number of processes P.
Explain the results you obtain.</P>

<H2>Submission Guidelines</H2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Submit all your code files as ONE tarred-gzipped file (.tgz file) on the blackboard. DO NOT SUBMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY. Make one .tgz file. Check the submission guidelines on course web page for how to prepare a .tgz file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Also submit a report, either in PDF or DOC format, explaining the results from Part C, as part of the above .tgz file.
