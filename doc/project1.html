<h2> Description</h2>
</a>

<p>This assignment helps you learn about 
processes and basic process management in a shell.
You are asked to write a simple shell program called <tt>cs350sh</tt>.
This shell must work as follows. You start the shell by typing 
<tt>cs350sh</tt> at the prompt.
This will give a prompt of your shell as follows:

<pre>
cs350sh>
</pre>

From here onwards, you should be able to execute and control 
<b>any program/command</b> just as you
would in a normal shell. 
For instance 

<pre>
cs350sh> ls

[ OUTPUT OF ls COMMAND SHOWN HERE ]

cs350sh>
</pre>


<p>
Additionally, your shell should be able to do the following: 
</p>

<ol> 

	<li>
		Execute commands with multiple arguments. For example:
		<pre>
		cs350sh> Command arg1 arg2 arg3
		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Execute commands in either foreground or background mode. In foreground mode, the shell just waits for the command to complete before displaying the shell prompt again (as in the above example). In background mode, a command is executed with an ampersand <tt>&</tt> suffix. The shell prompt appears immediately after typing a command name (say Command1) and shell becomes ready to accept and execute the next command (say Command2), even as Command1 continues executing in the <i>background</i>. For example:
		<pre>
		cs350sh> Command1 &
		cs350sh> Command2

		[OUTPUT OF Command1 AND Command2 MAY INTERLEAVE HERE IN ARBITRARY ORDER]
		</pre>

	</li>

	<li>
		Maintain multiple processes running in background mode simultaneously. For example:
		<pre>
		cs350sh> Command1 &
		cs350sh> Command2 &
		cs350sh> Command3 &
		cs350sh> 

		[OUTPUT OF Command1, Command2, AND Command3 MAY INTERLEAVE HERE IN ARBITRARY ORDER]

		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>	
		Redirect the input of a command from a file. For example:
		<pre>
		cs350sh> Command < input_file
		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Redirect the output of a command to a file. For example:
		<pre>
		cs350sh> Command > output_file
		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Be able to execute any combination of the above features.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Do Nots:</h2>
</a>
<ul> 
	<li>
		DO NOT use any special wrapper libraries or classes to borrow the basic functionality required in this assignment. If in doubt, ask the instructor first BEFORE doing so.
	</li> 
	<li>
		DO NOT use the <b>system(...) </b> syscall to execute the programs in your shell directly.
	</li> 
	<li> 
		DO NOT write five or six different programs, one for each feature. Write <b>one single program</b> that includes all the above features. 
	</li> 
</ul> 

<a name=hints>
<h2>Hints:</h2> 
</a>

<ul> 
  <li>Build  and test one functionality at a time. </li> 
  <li>Make backup copies of partially working versions of your code. This way, if you irreparably screw up your code, then you can at least roll back to your last backup copy. </li> 
  <li>First design your data structures and code-structure before you begin coding each feature. Anticipate specific problems you will face. </li> 
  <li>Check out man page for the following:
    <ul> 
	<li>fork()</li>
	<li>execv() and execl() (which one should you use?)</li>
	<li>waitpid()</li> 
	<li>dup2() (for stdin/stdout redirection) </li>
	<li>open()</li> 
	<li>close()</li> 
	<li>fileno()</li> 
	<!--
	<li> kill()</li> 
	<li> chdir()</li> 
	<li> getcwd()</li> 
	<li>killpg()</li> 
	<li>setsid()</li> 
	<li>getgrp()</li> 
	<li>getpgid()</li> 
	<li>tcsetpgrp()</li> 
	-->
    </ul> 
  </li> 
</ul>

<h2> Grading Guidelines </h2>
</a>

<pre>
	This is how we will grade your assignment during the demo. So please prioritize your work accordingly.

	5 - README, Makefile, Compilation without errors

	10 - Executing a command with no arguments in foreground 

	10 - Executing a command with multiple arguments in foreground 

	10 - Executing a single command in background

	20 - Executing multiple commands in background simultaneously

	10 - Input redirection: Executing a single command that takes standard input (stdin) from a file

	10 - Output redirection: Executing a single command that sends standard output (stdout) to a file

	40 - Combinations
		10 - Executing a background command with multiple arguments 
		10 - Executing a background command with redirected stdin/stdout
		10 - Executing a command with multiple arguments and redirected stdin/stdout
		10 - Executing one command in foreground and one or more commands in background
		
	20 - Explaining the code during demo.

	5 - Error Handling
		Most important part here is to make sure that you check and handle the errors 
		returned by ALL systems calls used in your program. Also check for other common 
		error conditions in your program. But don't go overboard with error checking. 
		We will not try to intentionally break your code with bad input that's irrelevant 
		to the assignment's goals.

	Total = 140

<!--
  <li>Know the difference between <b>SIGSTOP </b>and <b>SIGTSTP</b>. Which one
    should you use?</li> 
   -->
<!--

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">'cd' </span>command must
actually change the directory of your shell and <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'pwd' </span>must return the current
directory of your shell. Note that normal <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'fork-exec' </span>mechanism won't work
here. Why?<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Terminate a process by pressing <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;Ctrl-C&gt;.
    </span>Your shell must not get killed, only the process running
inside your shell must terminate.</li> 
  <li>Temporarily stop a process using <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;.
    </span>Your shell must not stop, only the process running inside
your shell must stop. Your shell must be able to hold multiple
processes in stopped state.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Background a process using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'bg'</span>
directive. Your shell must be able to hold multiple
processes running in background.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Kill a stopped process or a process in background using the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'kill'</span> directive.</li> 
  <li>Any signal should be delivered to the entire <i><b>process-group</b> </i>of
    the immediate child process, not just to the immediate child process. For
    example, if <b>cs350sh </b>starts process A and process A forks another process
    B, then any signal should be delivered to both process A and process B. How
    will you do this? For this you need to understand the notion of a <b><i>process
    group</i>. </b>Check out the man pages for <b>setsid()</b> and <b>killpg()</b>.</li> 
  <li>Bring a process to foreground using the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'fg' </span>directive. The <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'fg'</span> directive must be able to bring
any stopped/backgrounded process to foreground using the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">"%N" </span>argument<span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></li> 
  <li>Be able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">pipe</span> the
output of one process to the input of another process. For instance <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'ls -l | grep foo | less'.</span>
Your shell must be able to handle pipelines that are at least 10 commands long (though ideally it should be any arbitrary length).</li> 
  <li>Be able to redirect the output of a process (or a pipeline) to a
file. For example <span style="font-weight: bold;">'ls -l | grep
foo &gt; some_file'.</span><br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Be able to receive input for a process from a file. For
example <span style="font-weight: bold;">'cat &lt; some_file'.</span></li> 
  <li>Be able to combine the two operations. For example <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">'cat &lt; some_file &gt; some_other_file'<br> 
    </span></li> 
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">'exit'
    </span></span>directive should terminate your shell. Take
care to avoid <span style="font-weight: bold;">'orphan'</span> 
processes.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do not</span> need to
implement any scripting functionalities.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>You <b>do not</b> need to implement wild character expansions such as *,?,[0-9], etc.<br></li> 
</ul> 
  <p><b>Ten Bonus points:</b></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><i><b>Correctly</b></i> handle both standard input and standard output
      from programs executed by cs350sh. Inputs and outputs should be handled
      correctly especially when backgrounding and foregrounding a command.
      Its not as simple as it seems. Why?</li>
