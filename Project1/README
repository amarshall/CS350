CS350 Shell
@author J. Andrew Marshall <jmarsha6@binghamton.edu>

Default binary name is "cs350sh".

Type "exit" to exit the shell.

As is consistant with sh, an ampersand at the end of the command causes it to be backgrounded.
Continuing with consistancy with sh, '>' is for output redirection, and '<' is for input redirection.
